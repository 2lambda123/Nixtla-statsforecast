Explain, as detailed as possible, how to use Amazon Forecast. If possible, includes images or videos or gifs. 

Amazon Forecast is a fully managed machine learning service for time series forecasting. It utilizes deep learning algorithms to generate accurate predictions with minimal effort. 

To get started, you first need to create a Dataset Group. A Dataset Group is a collection of related datasets that you can use to generate forecasts. You can create a Dataset Group by selecting the ‘Create Dataset Group’ option in the Amazon Forecast console.

Once you have created a Dataset Group, you can then add datasets to it. To add a dataset, select the ‘Create Dataset’ option in the Amazon Forecast console.

Once you have added datasets to your Dataset Group, you can then create a Forecast. To create a Forecast, select the ‘Create Forecast’ option in the Amazon Forecast console.

You can then use the Forecast to generate predictions. To generate a prediction, select the ‘Generate Forecast’ option in the Amazon Forecast console.

Finally, you can analyze the accuracy of your predictions. To analyze the accuracy of your predictions, select the ‘Evaluate Forecast’ option in the Amazon Fore

please continue wit the above explanation 

Once you have evaluated the accuracy of your predictions, you can then deploy your Forecast. To deploy your Forecast, select the ‘Deploy Forecast’ option in the Amazon Forecast console.

Once you have deployed your Forecast, you can then use it to generate predictions. To generate a prediction, select the ‘Predict’ option in the Amazon Forecast console.

You can also use Amazon Forecast to generate forecasts for specific time intervals. To generate a forecast for a specific time interval, select the ‘Generate Forecast for Time Interval’ option in the Amazon Forecast console.

Finally, you can use Amazon Forecast to generate forecasts using AutoML. To generate a forecast using AutoML, select the ‘AutoML’ option in the Amazon Forecast console.

Could you show me some code using the AWS CLI?

Yes, here is an example of using the AWS CLI to create a Dataset Group in Amazon Forecast: 

aws forecast create-dataset-group --dataset-group-name "my-dataset-group" --domain "RETAIL"

This command creates a Dataset Group with the name “my-dataset-group” and a domain of “RETAIL”. You can then use this Dataset Group to generate forecasts.

Please show me the complete code to use Amazon Forecast with the AWS CLI, including Datasets, Forecast and predictions. 

Here is a complete example of how you can use the AWS CLI to use Amazon Forecast, including creating datasets, forecasts, and predictions: 

# Create a Dataset Group
aws forecast create-dataset-group --dataset-group-name "my-dataset-group" --domain "RETAIL"

# Create a Dataset
aws forecast create-dataset --dataset-group-arn "arn:aws:forecast:us-east-1:<AWS-ACCOUNT-ID>:dataset-group/my-dataset-group" --dataset-type "TARGET_TIME_SERIES" --data-frequency "W" --schema '{ "Attributes": [ { "AttributeName": "item_id", "AttributeType": "string" }, { "AttributeName": "timestamp", "AttributeType": "timestamp" }, { "AttributeName": "demand", "AttributeType": "float" } ] }' --dataset-name "my-dataset"

# Create a Forecast
aws forecast create-forecast-export-job --forecast-
