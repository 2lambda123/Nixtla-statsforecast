In this experiment, we compare in time and accuracy `AmazonForecast` with a fully open-source solution provided by `StatsForecast`. For the comparison, we use two datasets: M5 and M4 Daily.

The results show that the open-source solution from `StatsForecast` is:

- 60% more accurate than `AmazonForecast` and 16 times faster on M5.
- 4% more accurate than `AmazonForecast` and 18 times faster on M4.

Detailed results per dataset are shown below.
