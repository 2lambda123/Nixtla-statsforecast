    "The Seasonal Exponential Smoothing Optimized (SESO) model is a forecasting technique used to predict future values of a time series that exhibits seasonal patterns. It is a variant of the exponential smoothing method, which uses a combination of past and predicted values to generate a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SESO algorithm uses an optimization approach to find the optimal values of the seasonal exponential smoothing parameters. These parameters include the smoothing coefficients for the levels, trends, and seasonal components of the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SESO model is particularly useful for forecasting time series with pronounced seasonal patterns, such as seasonal product sales or seasonal temperatures, and many other areas. By using SESO, accurate and useful forecasts can be generated for business planning and decision making."

    "The SESO model is based on the exponential smoothing method, which uses a combination of past and predicted values to generate a prediction. The mathematical formula for the SESO model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}{t+1,s} = \\alpha y_t + (1-\\alpha) \\hat{y}{t-1,s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}{t+1,s}$ is the forecast for the next period of the season $s$.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the smoothing parameter that is optimized by minimizing the squared error.\n",
    "- $y_t$ is the current observation of station $s$ in period $t$.\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}{t-1,s}$ is the forecast for the previous period of the season $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation indicates that the forecast value for the next season period $s$ is calculated as a weighted combination of the current observation and the previous forecast for the same station. The smoothing parameter $\\alpha$ controls the relative influence of these two terms on the final prediction. A high value of α gives more weight to the current observation and less weight to the previous forecast, making the model more sensitive to recent changes in the time series. A low value of $\\alpha$, on the other hand, gives more weight to the previous forecast and less weight to the current observation, making the model more stable and smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal value of the smoothing parameter $\\alpha$ is determined by minimizing the squared error between the forecasts generated by the model and the actual values of the time series."

    "## **2.1 Model selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection in the context of the SESO model refers to the process of choosing the optimal values of the smoothing parameters and the seasonal component for the model. The optimal values of these parameters are the ones that result in the best forecast performance for the given data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great advantage of the ETS statistical framework is that information criteria can be used for model selection. The $AIC, AIC_c$ and $BIC$, that also can be used here to determine which of the ETS models is most appropriate for a given time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ETS models, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) is defined as\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC} = -2\\log(L) + 2k,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is the likelihood of the model and $k$ is the total number of parameters and initial states that have been estimated (including the residual variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "The AIC corrected for small sample bias ($AIC_c$) is defined as\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC}_{\\text{c}} = \\text{AIC} + \\frac{2k(k+1)}{T-k-1},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is\n",
    "$$\\text{BIC} = \\text{AIC} + k[\\log(T)-2].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These criteria balance the goodness of fit with the complexity of the model and provide a way to choose the model that maximizes the likelihood of the data while minimizing the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these techniques, expert judgment and domain knowledge can also be used to select the optimal SESO model. This involves considering the underlying dynamics of the time series, the patterns of seasonality, and any other relevant factors that may influence the choice of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the process of model selection for the SESO model involves a combination of statistical techniques, information criteria, and expert judgment to identify the optimal values of the smoothing parameters and the seasonal component that result in the best forecast performance for the given data set."

There can be many reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction. Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series. These components are:\n",

    "* **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or decreasing patterns in a time series.\n",
